  Water budgets are used to understand the movement of water into and out of a
  watershed. Much like a financial budget, inflows, storage, and outflows can
  be thought of like income, account balance, and expenses respectively. Unlike
  a bank account, we don't have perfect information about the flows of water
  into and out of a watershed.

  In this data visualization, you can see how three major components of the
  water budget vary across the conterminous US. Precipitation is incoming rain
  and snow; evapotranspiration is outgoing evaporation from soil and
  water bodies and transpiration through plants; and runoff is excess water that
  makes its way to lakes and rivers through streams and spring discharges. Each 
  of these components is estimated with a variety of measurement and modeling methods.

  With perfect information, the water budget bar charts shown here would
  “balance”, showing that in the long run, inflows to each watershed are equal
  to outflows, barring any changes in storage. The “Unknown” component in the
  bar charts is meant to highlight the fact that our best estimate of three
  major water budget components don't balance perfectly. So why might these
  data not balance? We know the unknown term can be composed of (1) changes in
  storage, (2) uncertainty in data, and (3) unquantified sources and sinks.

  The water balance shown here neglects one of the most difficult terms to
  quantify -- storage. The amount of water stored in a particular watershed,
  whether in lakes, aquifers, or any other storage, fluctuates over time; at
  times contributing extra water to outflows (shrinking stores) and at other
  times withholding water from outflows (increasing stores). Using the bank
  analogy, storage is the amount of money in a bank account. For a given period
  of time, the inflows and outflows may not be equivalent and the balance may
  shift. While this can be less important for long-term balances as is shown
  here, it becomes more important at monthly or daily time scales, making it a
  very important aspect of the water budget. The National Water Census (NWC) is
  exploring remotely sensed products and additional observational datasets such
  as groundwater well data to improve our characterization of storage.

  Layered into all of these hydrologic observations is an unknown or
  unquantified degree of uncertainty - no measurement is exact. The NWC is
  collecting and analyzing numerous observational and simulated data sets to
  begin to understand the degree of uncertainty in the water budget. Work can
  also be undertaken to understand and reduce specific sources of uncertainty
  and to incorporate information on uncertainty into our characterization of
  the water budget. The final source of the “unknown” in the water budget stems
  from the fact that current hydrologic data products may not have captured all
  of the components of the water budget, resulting in unquantified components
  of the water budget. These could be natural processes that we know we have not
  accounted for (such as groundwater flow out of a watershed) or human water
  use. The NWC continues to apply cutting-edge science to expanding our ability
  to account for the complete water budget.

  As we go forward, the NWC aims to improve our understanding of the unknowns
  in the water budget for every watershed in the country. In addition to
  improving our observational datasets and our understanding of their
  uncertainties, the National Water Census is developing a model to estimate
  components of the water budget. Building upon knowledge gained through
  comprehensive analysis of observational datasets, this model can be used to
  understand how the different water budget components relate to one another
  and may change under various land use and water management scenarios.
