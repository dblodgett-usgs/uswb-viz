  Water budgets are used to understand the movement of water into and out 
  of a watershed. Much like a financial budget, inflows, storage, and outflows 
  can be thought of like income, account balance, and expenses respectively. 
  Unlike a bank account, we don't have perfect information about the flows of 
  water into and out of a watershed.

  In this data visualization, you can see how three major components of the 
  water budget vary across the conterminous US. Precipitation is incoming rain 
  and snow, evapotranspiration is outgoing evaporation from soil and waterbodies 
  and transpiration through plants, and runoff is excess water that makes its 
  way to a river outlet through groundwater springs, streams, and lakes. Each 
  of these components is estimated with a variety of measurement and modeling methods.

  With perfect information, the water budget bar charts shown here would "balance", 
  showing that in the long run, inflows to each watershed are equal to outflows. 
  The "Unknown" component in the bar charts is meant to highlight the fact that our 
  best estimate of three major water budget components don't balance as we might expect. 
  As we go forward, USGS National Water Census projects aim to eliminate the unknowns in 
  the water budget for every watershed in the country. This is being done by estimating 
  additional components and by working to improve the accuracy of the estimates of all 
  components.

  These independent water budget components can be studied in isolation or used in a 
  model that combines and compares them into a balanced water budget. As the National 
  Water Census progresses such a model will be built and vetted to report all significant 
  inflow and outflow components of the water budget as well as the other components of a 
  watershed’s water budget, such as, interbasin transfers of water, consumptive water use, 
  recharge to groundwater systems that don’t discharge to the watershed of interest, and 
  the state of storage in the watershed. Because inflows must equal outflows over the long 
  term, storage doesn't appear in the bar charts shown for the sampling of watersheds here, 
  but at monthly or daily time steps, storage varies and is a very important aspect of the 
  water budget for many water availability decisions.

  A major issue that the WAUSP program needs to face is how to quantify and communicate the 
  "unknowns" in this water budget analysis. First, we can just look at all the things we 
  intuitively know are going on in each watershed and acknowledge that we have not yet 
  quantified these components. Where we know it to be true, this would include consumptive 
  water use, interbasin transfers, soil moisture deficits, operational factors with reservoirs, 
  voids in reservoir storage, recharge to groundwater systems, etc. We can acknowledge these 
  as unknowns. Second, we can acknowledge that our monitoring systems do not perfectly measure 
  the amount of water in each component of the hydrologic cycle. This is certainly true in the 
  case of precipitation, ET, and streamflow. WAUSP could develop conventions for how to show 
  the “uncertainty” for these components and apply those to the visualization.
