  Water budgets are used to understand the movement of water into and out of a
  watershed. Much like a financial budget, inflows, storage, and outflows can
  be thought of like income, account balance, and expenses respectively.
  Unlike a bank account, we don't have perfect information about the flows of
  water into and out of a watershed.  

  In this data visualization, you can see how three major components of the
  water budget vary across the conterminous US. Precipitation is incoming rain
  and snow; evapotranspiration is outgoing evaporation from soil and water
  bodies and transpiration through plants; and runoff is excess water that
  makes its way to lakes and rivers through streams and spring discharges.
  Each of these components is estimated with a variety of measurement and
  modeling methods.  

  With perfect information, the water budget bar charts shown here would
  “balance”, showing that in the long run, inflows to each watershed are equal
  to outflows plus changes in storage. The imbalance in the bar charts
  highlights that our best estimates of the three major water budget
  components don't balance perfectly. Why might the budget not balance? We
  know the imbalance can be the result of (1) changes in storage, (2)
  unquantified sources and sinks, and (3) uncertainty in data. Although the
  imbalance is the difference between in and out, the true and complete (but
  unknown) budget could have additional terms on both sides (explanations 1 or
  2) and could have larger or smaller values for any of the existing terms
  (explanation 3).  

  The water budget shown here is missing one of the most difficult terms to
  quantify – change in storage. The amount of water stored in a particular
  watershed, whether in lakes, aquifers, or any other storage, fluctuates over
  time; at times storage shrinks due to larger outflows and/or smaller
  inflows, and at other times storage increases due to smaller outflows and/or
  larger inflows. Using the bank analogy, storage is the amount of money in a
  bank account. For a given period of time, the inflows and outflows may not
  be equivalent and the balance may shift. While this can be less important
  for long-term balances as is shown here, it becomes more important at
  monthly or daily time scales, making it a very important aspect of the water
  budget. The National Water Census (NWC) is exploring remotely sensed
  products and additional observational datasets such as groundwater well data
  to improve our characterization of storage.  

  The “imbalance” in the water budgets also stems from unquantified
  components. These could include human water use or natural processes such as
  groundwater flow out of a watershed. The NWC continues to apply cutting-edge
  science to expanding our ability to account for the complete water budget.No
  measurement is exact. Each of the water budget components shown here has
  some unknown uncertainty included in it. The NWC is analyzing observational
  and simulated data sets to to understand these uncertainties.  

  As we go forward, the NWC aims to improve our understanding of the unknowns
  in the water budget for every watershed in the country. In addition to
  improving our observational datasets and our understanding of their
  uncertainties, the NWC is developing a model to combine these datasets to
  estimate a complete and closed water budget. Building upon knowledge gained
  through comprehensive analysis of observational datasets, this model can be
  used to understand how the different water budget components relate to one
  another and may change under various land use and water management scenarios.
